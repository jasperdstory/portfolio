<h4>As a PM, I’ve shipped data, mobile, web and sensor products. Now I’m searching for my next challenge.</h4>

<p>
I’ve led teams for a tech startup, at a large tech company, and as a maths teacher at an inner-city school.
</p>

<p>
At the startup, Viewsy, we delivered performance data to real-world retailers to enable smarter, data-driven decisions. We delivered simple, modern, team apps, powered by analytics extracted from a large distributed sensor network.
</p>

<p>
There were three key shipped products from my time at Viewsy I focus on here. News - a newsfeed app powered by data-reporting bots, Dashboards - a simple, fast, KPI app for teams, and Journeys - a complex ML data system which transformed noisy sensor data into concrete retail performance metrics.
</p>

<p>
Before that, I worked on a variety of product and program management growth projects with Google, while as an intern and as a consultant. I go through some of my work for the global Google Apps teams.</p>
