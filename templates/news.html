<p>
Retail store managers are the CEOs of their store. They are responsible for everything from hiring and hitting targets to managing ops and running campaigns. Great store managers don’t just manage, they inspire. A lot of their time is spent away from their desks, on the shop-floor. 
</p>
<p>
Store managers communicate both up and down the retail organisation – to their managers and to their staff. A retailer may have over 100 store teams.
</p>
<p>
But communication and collaboration within store teams faced many problems, resulting in poor teamwork.
</p>
<p>
A common example plays out like this. Store managers are judged on their sales. If they are down one week, the store manager will find out with a call on Monday morning from their boss. With only sales results at hand, it’s difficult to pin down why sales are down. Fingers are pointed, and these calls are rarely productive. This information problem cascades down the store team to employees.
</p>
<p>
Some store teams of leading retailers were trying to use public social networks to try and solve the problem themselves. They would share sales numbers and key results, often hand-calculated in spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
Enter News. We designed News to help retail teams become faster, happier, and more productive. 
</p>
<h6>Instant Feedback</h6>
<p>
We wanted to speed up the feedback loop and provide users with instant results. When managers have instant feedback on store results they could worry less, plan better, and adapt quicker. Retail organisations typically worked off data days or weeks late. We were going to reduce this to seconds.
</p>
<p>
With full APNS support, we could deliver scorecards to without friction before users left the office or locked up the store.
</p>
<h6>Smoke Alarms</h6>
<p>
One problem with traditional reporting was that results were communicated after the fact, so managers could not be proactive. By delivering key indicators store managers cared about before the end of the week, could react faster. By analysing past performance, we could identify when on-going results were signifcantly above or below average and only alert users when critical action was needed.
</p>
<h6>Diagnose Sales Problems</h6>
<p>
Reporting sales and visitor statistics could only tell a limited story what was happening. Users didn't just want to know their sales were down 10% this week. They wanted to know why.
</p>
<p>
Low sales could mean low sales-per-visitor, poor conversion, or even poor street footfall. By bringing a dollar value to the entire customer funnel at the story, we could tell the story of why sales were down, and what to do next.  Store teams could pin-point weaknesses and strengths with their stores, bringing a richer dialogue with their employees and managers.
