<p>
Before Dashboards, the main way users accessed Viewsy was through email reports. Users loved that they received a summary of key store statistics and analysis sent to their inbox every week or month. Accessing reports was frictionless, and they looked great in mobile mailboxes.
</p>
<p>
But reports weren’t flexible enough to fit into the complex structure of a modern retail business. Different retail teams have different priorities. There were teams in place to manage each of the hundred or more stores. Marketing and merchandising teams at head office launch sophisticated campaigns. A layer of business leaders at the top set the strategic course for the company across many channels. Different teams teams had different time-horizons: for store team the last week was important, for executives the last six months.
</p>
<p>
So while email reports were a great start, they weren’t targeted, focused or relevant enough for different teams in different retailers.  But we were resistant to content-creation tools (letting users build the reports themselves), because it meant user experience and build complexity.
</p>
<p>
User experience complexity was a big problem for even best-in-class business intelligence products for organisations, products like Tableau or Domo. They were too complex and too general. Users want to know their critical results. They don’t want to construct bar graphs, move about generic data objects, and tweak axes. The industry leaders had sacrificed simplicity to support the many industries they targeted.
